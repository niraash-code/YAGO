YAGO is a high-performance, next-generation modding platform that bridges the gap between a user-friendly Game Manager and a technical Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for modders.

- **Tier 1 (Native Logic Support):** Genshin Impact, Honkai: Star Rail, Zenless Zone Zero, Wuthering Waves (GIMI/SRMI/ZZZMI logic).
- **Tier 2 (Legacy Support):** Dead or Alive 6, SoulCalibur VI.
- **Tier 3 (Future Expansion):** Unreal Engine Gachas (Tower of Fantasy, Snowbreak) via `.pak` logic.

> **⚠️ Project Status: ALPHA**  
> YAGO is currently in active development. There are **no public builds available** at this time. We are focused on architectural stability and core feature completion before an initial public release.

## 🌟 The Vision: The "Quad-Lemma" Solution

YAGO solves four critical ecosystem failures simultaneously:

### 1. The Organizer (For Players) - Ease
- **Virtual File System**: Mods stay clean in a Library. YAGO deploys them instantly using zero-copy Symlinks.
- **Context-Aware**: Automatically switches logic based on the game (Genshin Regions vs. Star Rail Planets).
- **Safety First**: Global "Streamer Mode" (NSFW Blur/Kill-switch) and non-destructive file handling.

### 2. The IDE (For Modders) - Power
- **Logic Compiler**: Automatically writes complex .ini logic for Toggles, Region Switching, and Sub-Mods.
- **Static Analysis**: A "Fake Interpreter" that validates mod logic before deployment to prevent game crashes.
- **Standardization**: Implements the `mod.json` manifest standard for cross-tool compatibility.

## 🧩 Architecture: The 8 Pillars

The core logic is distributed across 8 specialized Rust crates. For a deep architectural dive, see [**STRUCTURE.md**](STRUCTURE.md).

| Crate | Responsibility | Key Tech |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`fs_engine`** | VFS (Symlinks), Archive extraction, Atomic operations. | `zip`, `sevenz-rust` |
| **`ini_forge`** | Logic-aware .ini parsing with `if/endif` support. | `nom` |
| **`logic_weaver`** | Deployment planning, INI merging, DXBC patching. | (Pure Rust) |
| **`librarian`** | Decentralized databases, Metadata, Game discovery. | `serde`, `chrono` |
| **`proc_marshal`** | Process execution, FPS Unlocking, Sandbox snapshots. | `sysinfo`, `tokio` |
| **`loader_ctl`** | Mod loader installation & dual-proxy chaining. | (Pure Rust) |
| **`quartermaster`** | High-perf asset caching and network fetching. | `reqwest`, `md5` |
| **`sophon_engine`** | Maintenance Brain: Block-level parallel downloader and delta patcher. | `hpatchz`, `tokio`, `md5` |

## 🏗️ Technical Innovations

### Sophon Content Delivery
YAGO features a native implementation of the Sophon protocol, allowing it to maintain games completely independently:
- **Block-Level Deduplication**: Chunks shared between versions or language packs are downloaded only once.
- **Bit-Perfect Patching**: Native FFI bridge to `HDiffZ` ensuring delta updates are identical to official patches.
- **Selective Installation**: Install only the languages and audio packs you need to save bandwidth and disk space.
- **Hybrid Integrity**: Tiered scanning (Fast/Metadata vs. Deep/MD5) ensures library health without the performance penalty of a full hash pass.

### Decentralized Storage & Sharing
YAGO gives you total control over your data footprint:
- **Granular Overrides**: Store your 100GB+ Mod library on an external SSD while keeping the app configuration in `app_data`.
- **Resource Sharing**: Point YAGO to existing Proton runners or WINE prefixes used by other launchers (Steam, Lutris) to save space.
- **Portability**: If you wipe YAGO or move systems, your mods and prefixes remain intact and can be instantly re-linked.

### Recursive Auto-Discovery
Point YAGO to your primary Games folder (e.g., `~/Games`), and it will perform a deep recursive scan (up to 4 levels) to automatically identify and import all supported titles into your library.

## 📋 Ecosystem Standards

### `mod.json` Specification v1.3
YAGO implements standardized metadata to ensure mods are portable and self-describing:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1.3,
  "meta": {
    "name": "Raiden Shogun - Boss Skin",
    "version": "1.0",
    "author": "ModGod"
  },
  "compatibility": {
    "game": "Genshin Impact",
    "character": "Raiden",
    "fingerprint": "A1B2C3D4..."
  },
  "config": {
    "tags": ["NSFW", "INA"],
    "keybinds": {
      "slot_1": { "label": "Toggle Skirt", "variable": "$skirt_state" }
    }
  }
}
```

## 📦 Building & Release

### Release Packages
YAGO supports multiple formats via the `Makefile`:
```bash
make release-appimage   # Linux AppImage
make release-flatpak    # Linux Flatpak
make release-deb        # Debian/Ubuntu DEB
make release-rpm        # Fedora/RHEL RPM
make release-pkgbuild   # Arch Linux PKGBUILD
make release-windows    # Windows EXE
```

### Compatibility Building (GLIBC Fix)
To ensure DEB/RPM packages work on older Linux distributions, use the containerized build system:
1. Install **Distrobox**.
2. Run `./build_tools/setup-build-containers.sh`.
3. Build normally (e.g., `make release-deb`). The system will detect the containers automatically.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### GUI Window Issues (Wayland)
If the window doesn't appear correctly on Wayland (KDE/GNOME), force the GDK backend:
```bash
GDK_BACKEND=wayland cargo tauri dev
```

### Build Dependencies
Ensure your system has the following installed:
- **Arch**: `gtk3 webkit2gtk`
- **Ubuntu/Debian**: `libgtk-3-0 libwebkit2gtk-4.1-0`
