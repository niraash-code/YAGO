# Safety & Streamer Mode

Safety is a core pillar of YAGO. We provide tools to protect your account and your audience.

## 📺 Streamer Mode

Streamer mode protects your stream from sensitive content:

- **Blur**: NSFW mod cards are blurred in the UI (`filter: blur(6px)`).
- **Text Obfuscation**: Mod names and tags are hidden.
- **Panic Switch**: Pressing **F12** instantly kills the overlay and reverts character skins to vanilla.

## 🛡️ Anti-Ban Measures

- **Non-Destructive**: YAGO never modifies your game files.
- **Proxy/Loader Logic**: We use the safest possible methods to inject mods.
- **Metadata Hygiene**: Screenshots taken through YAGO have their EXIF and UID data stripped to protect your account.

## ⚖️ Legal Disclaimer

YAGO is an open-source tool provided for educational and personal organization purposes. 

1. **Risk Assumption**: You use this software at your own risk. The developers are not liable for any account bans, data corruption, or hardware issues resulting from the use of YAGO or any third-party mods.
2. **No Endorsement of Client Modification**: We do not encourage, facilitate, or support the creation or use of modified game clients. YAGO utilizes external injection methods (like 3DMigoto) which are intended to be non-invasive to game binaries.
